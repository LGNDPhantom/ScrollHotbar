# ScrollHotbar

ScrollHotbar is a simple quality-of-life mod for **Valheim** that lets you cycle through your hotbar items using the mouse wheel. It also intelligently handles camera zooming — scroll the wheel freely to swap items, or hold **Left Ctrl** to adjust the zoom instead.

## 🧰 Features

- ✅ Scroll the mouse wheel to cycle through hotbar slots (1–8).
- ✅ Hotbar selection wraps around — no getting stuck at the end.
- ✅ Slots are switched even if they are empty (so you can prep items).
- ✅ Hold **Left Ctrl** to zoom the camera in/out, just like the default Valheim behavior.
- ✅ When Ctrl is not held, zoom stays fixed and is not affected by scrolling.
- ✅ Scroll position is preserved between switches — no unexpected zoom resets.

## 🎮 How It Works

- Scrolling **up** selects the next hotbar slot.
- Scrolling **down** selects the previous one.
- If **Left Ctrl** is held, the scroll wheel is redirected to control camera zoom.
- Zoom levels persist until manually changed.
- Scrolling through empty slots is allowed so that you can still prepare them.
